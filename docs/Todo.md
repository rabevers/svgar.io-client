# Todo

Below is a list of things a "working" version should have. I will add new items as I gain new insights into things that have to be done. Completed Items will move to the bottom of the list.

- Build game loop
- Make player move
    - using mouse
    - Within boundaries of the map
- Create food
- Allow player to eat food and grow
- Make the map bigger than the game container (SVG viewport)


## Done
- Create Game component
- Create Map component
- Create Player component
