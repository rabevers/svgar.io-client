# SVGar.io

This project was created to see if the popular [Agar.io](https://agar.io/) game can be created using Svelte and SVG.

A list of things todo and done can be found [here](./docs/Todo.md).
The story of progress can be found [here](./docs/README.md).

Since I am not too well versed in SVG I will need to read up on some aspects. It may result in less than optimal solutions. But the idea is to make the project better as I go. So there should be plenty of time for improvement.
